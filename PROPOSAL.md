# Pac-Man

Author: Ananya Agarwal 

#### **IDEA** ####

For my final project, I would like to design the game Pac-Man. 
I have basic knowledge of c++ because of this course to write 
this game and I want to create this project because pacman has 
been a game which almost everyone hs played and I loved playing 
as a kid 

#### **EXTERNAL LIBRARIES:** ####

I want to animate my pacman, ghosts and food. After searching on the net, I have found a few libraries 
which will help me do that and I will finalise on using one either choreograph or
SQLite3 and SQLite modern cpp

#### **ROUGH TIMELINE** ####

##### **WEEK ONE:** #####
 Create a single level. All elements should work properly (Pac-Man,
ghosts, food, fruit, point system, etc.)

##### **WEEK TWO:** #####
 Create a home page that allows user to start a game or view
high scores. 

 Create a high score page that displays top scores.

##### **WEEK THREE:** #####
 Extend the game play so that the player keeps playing levels
until they lose all their lives rather than simply completing
one level. 

#### **STRETCH GOALS** ####
If I complete this project early, a stretch goal I could implement would
be creating multiple difficulties or settings. For example a dark or light mode and an easy
or difficult mode where ghosts have more life etc
